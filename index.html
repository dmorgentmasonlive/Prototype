<h2>Psychic Solider</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a soldier gifted with psychic abilities has been tasked with destroying a top
secret weapon from an enemy base. Explore the base by using your abilities to extract
information without being seen. The only weapon you have is your own mind.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel clever as the escape and outwit the guards during the journey to their goal.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a Stealth Game with Puzzle Element.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player will maneuver through the enemy base by avoiding the line"of"sight of
enemy guards (shown in"game as a flashlight.) The player also has psychic
abilities to help learn key locations and patrol routes:
Press 1: Third Eye/Mind Reading: The player freezes at their current location and the camera will follow a guard until the player moves again. Used to learn upcoming room and guard locations. The player can learn passwords and hints from nearby guards without
their knowledge. Used for interrogation.
Press 2: Telekinesis: Grab nearby items, open doors, and activate switches from afar. Used to
cause distractions.
Press 3:Hypnosis: After a short delay a guard will fall asleep. The guard will be easily woken up if another guard or the player approaches them. Used to knock-out guards non-lethally.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This Prototype is testing guard-player interactions and psychic abilities.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Non-Lethal Stealth Gameplay: No way to kill an enemy. All
obstacles must be dealt with through planning and stealth.
Psychic Abilities: Every ability has an approximate effect to key features
in other stealth games, but all work to enforce the non-lethal gameplay.
Exploration: There is more than one route to the weapon, and more than one
solution to every puzzle.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The base is controlled by a powerful supernation to house a powerful weapon. Due to interference from the weapon, electronic cameras do not work, so it employs many security guards. There are empty rooms the player can hide in, alarms that can be telekinetically pulled to lure enemies, and locks for the player to open.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
It is the height of a Cold War between two large and powerful nations. Both nations are
as close to peace as they are to war and any single action could tip the scales. At the same time as peace accords are being drafted powerful super weapons are being developed. Multiple third parties, eager to avoid war, are working to ensure peace. A third party,  has been able to develop a singular psychic super-solider. The solider has been tasked with destroying a super weapon. This means he must successfully infiltrate the enemy base without leaving any proof of the infiltration. If there is any proof that a spy has entered the base, war could be declared.
</li>
